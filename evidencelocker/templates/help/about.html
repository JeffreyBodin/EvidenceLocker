In Feb 2022, a reddit user posted about their experience surviving childhood sex trafficking by a parent, and the role that their own archived reddit posts had made in helping them escape and find safety and sanity. Numerous comments were made about how useful a dedicated evidence archival service would be in helping other such victims.

My own biological parents were narcissists, masters of emotional manipulation, and experts at gaslighting. It took years for me to crawl out from under the mental abuse, see through the gaslighting, set and enforce boundaries with my family of origin, and find a family of choice with my wife and inlaws.

While my own experience wasn't nearly as severe as the user on reddit, a tool like The Evidence Locker would nevertheless have been tremendously helpful to me, had it been available. Inspired by the reddit post, I decided to create that tool, and share it for free to help other people escape their own abusive living situations. Even if you don't need to share your evidence with law enforcement, an immutable record of the past can be an invaluable defence against both gaslighting and natural memory fallability.

If you like the mission of the Evidence Locker, [donations](/help/donate) to keep the servers running are greatly appreciated. More important than that, though, is spreading the word to other victims of abuse, so that it might help them find safety.
