## 1: Scope and Definitions

These terms of service ("Terms") are between The Evidence Locker and You, regarding your use of the platform theevidencelocker.com, its associated image hosting service, and any of its development servers which may exist now or in the future (collectively, "TEL")

Victim users, or victim accounts (collectively, "Victims") are users that submit information and evidence ("Exhibits") to TEL about their abuse (collectively, "TEL data").

Police users, police accounts, law enforcement users, LEO users, or LEO accounts (collectively, "Police") are law enforcement accounts that can access a selection of Victim-submitted TEL data based on jurisdiction and a Victim's sharing options.

All Terms apply to both Victim and Police accounts, except where otherwise specified.

## 2: Account Access

Your TEL account is nontransferable. You will not buy, sell, gift, loan, or otherwise grant a third party access to your TEL account. You will not provide a third party with your TEL password or two-factor authentication code.

## 3: Service Availability

## 4: No Legal Advice

You understand and acknowledge that material appearing on or through TEL are not intended to, and do not constitute, medical or legal advice. Use of TEL does not constitute an attorney-client relationship.

TEL does not claim ownership of any content submitted to TEL. However, in order to provide the service, we need your permission to process, display, reproduce, and distribute content you make available to us.

You grant TEL a permanent, worldwide, and irrevocable license to store, modify, copy, and distribute all content that you submit to or upload to TEL. Additionally, you grant TEL a permanent, worldwide, and irrevocable license to sublicense these same rights to TEL's service providers.

## 7: GDPR
    
This section applies to users located in the United Kingdom or the European Union.

You understand and acknowledge that content submitted to TEL is for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, and that GDPR's "right to be forgotten" therefore does not apply. Specifically, content submitted to TEL is potential evidence in an actual or prospective legal case.

You understand and agree that:

* TEL makes no claims about the truth of TEL data.
* TEL makes no other legal claims about the nature of TEL data.
* TEL is not party to any of the actual or prospective legal proceedings related to TEL data.
* Your access to TEL data is conditional on your continued employment as a law enforcement agent. TEL reserves the right to periodically confirm such continued employment, and suspend your access to TEL data until confirmation can be made.

On Exhibits displaying a perjury oath with an e-signature mark and date/time stamp, TEL warrants that a valid e-signature was obtained from the Victim at the indicated time for that Exhibit.

## 10: Victim Terms

This section applies only to Victim-type accounts.

You consent to the use of electronic signatures when attesting to the truthfulness of content you submit to your Locker.

## 11: No Implied Waiver

A failure by TEL in one or more instances to insist upon your strict adherence to these terms, shall not be construed as a waiver of any continuing or subsequent violations of these terms.

## 12: Severability

If one clause of these Terms or the Content Policy is determined by a court to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms and Content Policy shall remain in force.

## 13: Completeness

## 14: Updates

Whenever TEL updates these Terms, your continued use of the TEL platform constitutes your agreement to the updated terms of service.
