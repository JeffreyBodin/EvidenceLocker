  "What should I put in my Locker?":'''
    You should use your Locker to store photos, video, audio, text descriptions, or other evidence of an abusive incident, and you should do this as soon as possible after the incident occurs.

    You should *not* use your locker to store evidence obtained illegally - it could be used against you. Do not store unrelated content in your locker.

    Do not use your Locker to store photo/video evidence of underage sexual abuse. That counts as child pornography, and The Evidence Locker is not licensed to possess it. Submit it to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.org/) instead.
    ''',
  "How do I edit or delete the contents of my Locker?":'''
    Content saved to your Locker is potential evidence in a case against your abuser. Therefore, once you have signed a Locker entry, you cannot edit or delete it. Unsigned entries may still be edited by clicking the "Edit" button on the entry\'s page.''',
  "With whom will my locker be shared?":'''
    Your locker may be shared with:
    
    * Specific law enforcement agencies that you select
    * Any law enforcement agency in your home country, if you select that option in your settings AND the country is not in our [List of Restricted Countries](/help/restrictedcountries)
    * Any law enforcement agency in your home country with a warrant, if that country is not in our [List of Restricted Countries](/help/restrictedcountries)
    * Any law enforcement agency in your home country with a warrant that has been domesticated in the United States of America

  "I've shared my Locker with law enforcement. Now what?":"""
    The Evidence Locker cannot initiate legal action on your behalf. You will need to do that yourself. Provide the responding officer, detective, or other law enforcement agent with the link to your Locker.""",
  "Can you help review my Locker contents to make sure I have a good case?":"""
    No. The Evidence Locker does not provide legal advice or legal services of any kind. We are merely a specialized data storage and sharing service.""",
  "Why is two-factor authentication required?":"""
    Two-factor authentication provides an extra type of account security beyond simply remembering a password. This goes a long way in preventing accounts from being stolen, hacked, or shared. Our users store highly sensitive information with us, so we require all Evidence Locker users - including both victims and law enforcement - to use two-factor authentication.""",
  "How do I identify or validate digital signatures on The Evidence Locker?":"""
    Digital signatures that can be verified are identified with the following symbol: <i class="fas fa-signature-lock text-success"></i>. Digital signatures that cannot be verified are identified with this symbol instead: <i class="fas fa-signature-slash text-danger"></i>. Most digital signature symbols can be clicked on to show the detailed cryptographic information associated with them."""
  "Why does the timestamp look wrong?":"""
    Timestamps are displayed in UTC or \"Zulu\" time, and adjusted slightly for readability. UTC time is a standardized time format that does not take time zones or daylight savings into consideration. This ensures that there is only one possible way to read any particular timestamp displayed on this site.""",
  "Who owns and runs The Evidence Locker?":"""
    A man in the United States who goes by the username of \"CodeForge\". He would prefer to remain anonymous for now. [More info](/help/about)"""
