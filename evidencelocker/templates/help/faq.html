  "What should I put in my Locker?":'''
    You should use your Locker to store photos, text descriptions, or other evidence of an abusive incident, and you should do this as soon as possible after the incident occurs.

    You should *not* use your locker to store evidence obtained illegally - it could be used against you. Do not store unrelated content in your locker.

    Do not use your Locker to store photo/video evidence of underage sexual abuse. That counts as child pornography, and The Evidence Locker is not licensed to possess it. Submit it to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.org/) instead.
    ''',
  "How do I edit or delete the contents of my Locker?":"""
    Content saved to your Locker is potential evidence in a case against your abuser. Therefore, once you have signed a Locker exhibit, you cannot edit or delete it. Unsigned exhibits may still be edited or deleted from the exhibit's page.""",
  "Why can't I store video or audio in my Locker?":"""
    Audio and video recording laws vary widely from place to place. Since TEL always provide *all* signed Exhibits in a Locker to law enforcement, we don't want users to  accidentally \"contaminate\" their Locker with illegally obtained evidence. Therefore, TEL does not permit audio or video to be added to Lockers.

    Audio files can be transcribed and saved to TEL as text.

    Individual frames from video files can be captured as images and saved to TEL.""",
  "With whom will my locker be shared?":'''
    Your locker may be shared with:
    
    * Specific law enforcement agencies that you select
    * Any law enforcement agency in your home country, if you select that option in your settings AND the country is not in our [List of Restricted Countries](/help/restrictedcountries)
    * Any law enforcement agency in the United States with a warrant
    * Any law enforcement agency in your home country with a warrant that has been domesticated in the United States of America
    ''',
  "I've shared my Locker with law enforcement. Now what?":"""
    The Evidence Locker cannot initiate legal action on your behalf. You will need to do that yourself. Provide the responding officer, detective, or other law enforcement agent with the link to your Locker, or provide them with the public share link on your Locker's export page.""",
  "Can you help review my Locker contents to make sure I have a good case?":"""
    No. The Evidence Locker does not provide legal advice or legal services of any kind. We are merely a specialized data storage and sharing service.""",
  "Why is two-factor authentication required?":"""
    Two-factor authentication provides an extra type of account security beyond simply remembering a password. This goes a long way in preventing accounts from being stolen, hacked, or shared. Our users store highly sensitive information with us, so we require all Evidence Locker users - including both victims and law enforcement - to use two-factor authentication.""",
  "How do I identify or validate digital signatures on The Evidence Locker?":'''
     Whenever a digital signature is displayed, TEL attempts to re-validate the signature data against the Exhibit to which the signature is attached. TEL then displays one of the following symbols, based on whether or not the signature has been successfully re-validated:

     * <i class="fas fa-signature-lock text-success"></i> - Indicates a successfully re-validated digital signature. The Exhibit has not changed since it was signed.

     * <i class="fas fa-signature-slash text-danger"></i> - Indicates a digital signature that could not be re-validated. The Exhibit may or may not have changed since it was signed. This symbol should be rarely seen, if ever. Exhibits with invalid signatures may be re-signed, but not edited or deleted.

     * <i class="fas fa-signature text-black"></i> - There is no signature present. The exhibit has not been signed and may still be edited or deleted.''',
  "Can I change my username?":"""
    No. Your username is part of the Exhibit data that is used in your digital signatures. Changing your username would invalidate all of your existing digital signatures.""",
  "Why are all timestamps in UTC?":"""
    UTC time is a standardized clock that does not take time zones or daylight savings into consideration.

    In police investigations, a precise timeline of events is often necessary. By using UTC time instead of local time, we ensure that there is only ever one possible correct interpretation of the timestamp, regardless of travel, differences in location, or changing seasons.""",
  "Who owns and runs The Evidence Locker?":"""
    A man in the United States who goes by the username of \"CodeForge\". He would prefer to remain anonymous for now."""
