          Two-factor authentication provides an extra type of account security beyond simply remembering a password, helping prevent accounts from being stolen, hacked, or shared. Our users store highly sensitive information with us, so we require all Evidence Locker users - including both victims and law enforcement - to use two-factor authentication.
