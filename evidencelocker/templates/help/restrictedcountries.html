    <p>The following countries are considerd by The Evidence Locker to be systemically discriminatory against certain classes of abuse victims, and in some cases even participate in the abuse themselves. Therefore, to help protect the safety of our victim users, the "share with all law enforcement agencies in my home country" feature is disabled for these countries. All victim data must be explicitly shared with the specific law enforcement agency by the victim.</p>
