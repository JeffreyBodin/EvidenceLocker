    <p>The following countries are considerd by The Evidence Locker to be systemically discriminatory against certain classes of abuse victims, and in some cases even participate in the abuse themselves. Therefore, to help protect the safety of our victim users, law enforcement in these countries may not make warrant-less requests for victim data. All requests must be either approved by the Victim themselves (via their sharing options) or accompanied by a warrant that has been domesticated in the United States of America.</p>
